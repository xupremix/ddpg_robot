# DDPG Coin Collector Robot

This repository contains an implementation of a robot that navigates a 2D world to collect coins 
and deposit them in banks it discovers along the way.  
The underlying mechanism utilizes the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for continuous control with deep reinforcement learning, as proposed by Lillicrap et al. in 2015 ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)).
